/**
 * DOC: HDD WMM
 *
 * This module (wlan_hdd_wmm.h interface + wlan_hdd_wmm.c implementation)
 * houses all the logic for WMM in HDD.
 *
 * On the control path, it has the logic to setup QoS, modify QoS and delete
 * QoS (QoS here refers to a TSPEC). The setup QoS comes in two flavors: an
 * explicit application invoked and an internal HDD invoked.  The implicit QoS
 * is for applications that do NOT call the custom QCT WLAN OIDs for QoS but
 * which DO mark their traffic for priortization. It also has logic to start,
 * update and stop the U-APSD trigger frame generation. It also has logic to
 * read WMM related config parameters from the registry.
 *
 * On the data path, it has the logic to figure out the WMM AC of an egress
 * packet and when to signal TL to serve a particular AC queue. It also has the
 * logic to retrieve a packet based on WMM priority in response to a fetch from
 * TL.
 *
 * The remaining functions are utility functions for information hiding.
